        <p>Yttrine is the 19th element on the hypoiodous table, and has 15 valence electrons. Its symbol is <b>Yn</b> and is an element similar to <a href="yttum.html">yttum</a>. At standard conditions yttrine is a solid that forms complex gray cluster molecules. In the gas phase, it takes the form of Yn<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        <p>Yttrine is one of the elements commonly found grouped with yttum, and is thus a yttum group element. It is electron deficient compared to yttum, and can only form a maximum of 15 bonds compared to yttum's maximum of 16.</p>
        <p>Yttum commonly forms lewis acids and becomes part of adducts like hexadecahyperfluoroyttrinate (Yn<a href="hyperfluorine.html">Ho</a><sub>16</sub><sup>-</sup>), a weakly coordinating anion.</p>
        <p>Yttum is also commonly found with a 28-electron shell in molecules, like tetrahyperfluoroyttrinic acid (<a href="monodrogen.html">M</a>YnHo</a><sub>4</sub>)</p>
