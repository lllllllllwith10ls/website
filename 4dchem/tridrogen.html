        <p>Tridrogen is the third element on the hypoiodous table, and has three valence electron. Its symbol is <b>T</b> and is a gas that forms examples of <a href="overfilledbond.html">overfilled bonds</a>. It forms compounds with most nonmetallic elements. It is one of the N-drogens, which are common elements that terminate side chains.</p>
        <p>Tridrogen is commonly found in hyperwater, most commonly as <a href="ditridrogenhyperoxide.html">T<sub>2</sub>Dy</a>, and sometimes as <a href="ditritridrogenhyperoxide.html">(T<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Dy</a> and <a href="ditridrogentrihyperoxide.html">T<sub>2</sub>Dy<sub>3</sub></a>. T<sup>+3</sup>, T<sub>2</sub><sup>+2</sup>, and T<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ions are released in <a href="triacid.html">triacids</a>. It generally bonds with asymmetric 3-1 bonds, and can take electrons.</p>
