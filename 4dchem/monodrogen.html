        <h1>Monodrogen</h1>
        <p>Monodrogen is the first element on the hypoiodous table, and has only one valence electron, and one electron total. Its symbol is <b>M</b> and is the lightest element. At standard conditions monodrogen is a metal, and readily forms compounds with most nonmetallic elements. It is one of the N-drogens, which are common elements that terminate side chains.</p>
        <p>Monodrogen is commonly found in hyperwater, as <a href="monodrogenhyperoxide.html">M<sub>2</sub>Dy</a>, and is a major component of <a href="slickelorganics.html">slickelorganics</a>. M<sup>+</sup> ions are released in <a href="monoacid.html">monoacids</a>. It generally bonds with asymmetric 1-3 bonds, or ionizes.</p>
        
        <p>Monodrogen has a low boiling point for a metal, and commonly forms molecules of <b>tetramonodrogen</b>. It reacts with <a href="tridrogen.html">T</a> to form <a href="monodrogentridrige.html">MT</a>.</p>
