        <p>Hyperfluorine is the 67th element on the hypoiodous table, and has 63 valence electrons, making it a halogen. Its symbol is <b>Ho</b> and is one of the most reactive elements, due to it forming <a href="tesserabond.html">tesserabonds</a> in its pure state. At standard conditions hyperfluorine is a gas, and hyperfluorinates everything.</p>
        <p>Hyperfluorine is found mainly in salts, as <a href="tarbiumendoryhyperfluoride.html">TrHo</a>, <a href="soryhyperfluoride.html">ðŸ˜¥Ho</a>, and <a href="hyperlithiumhyperfluoride.html">LiHo</a>. It generally bonds with asymmetric 3-1 bonds.</p>
        <p>Hyperfluorine usually bonds with itself via a <a href="tesserabond.html">tesserabond</a>, contributing to its reactivity. It can set almost anything on fire, even at low temperatures. It reacts explosively with <a href="monodrogen.html">monodrogen</a> and all alkali metals.</p>
